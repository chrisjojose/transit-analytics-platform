# Real-time Public Transit Analytics Platform

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a real-time data engineering platform to analyze public transit data. It ingests live data streams from transit APIs, processes them using streaming technologies, stores the results in a data warehouse, and enables visualization through a BI tool. This serves as a portfolio project demonstrating a modern, end-to-end data pipeline.
